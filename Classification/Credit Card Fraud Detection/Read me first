In this exercise session you will consolidate your machine learning (ML) modeling skills by using 
two popular classification models to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions. 
These models are: Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine. You will use a real dataset to train each of these models. 
The dataset includes information about transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. 
You will use the trained model to assess if a credit card transaction is legitimate or not.
